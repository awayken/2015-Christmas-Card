She maintained her dedication to fitness with a thirteen-month daily exercising streak, despite travel, illness and children endlessly fascinated with the process. Just in time for winter, Holli got a remote starter installed in the van, which has brought her more joy than her husband ever has.",

We scoured the exhibits, first calling her name, then shouting it. We wound our way up and down staircase after staircase, through serpentine, dimly lit hallways, but she was gone. Holli made her way out of the exhibit, searching out an employee to raise the alarm. When she arrived, a Good Samaritan was already there with Ainsley in tow.
